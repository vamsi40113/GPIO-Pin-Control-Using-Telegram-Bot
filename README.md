# GPIO-Pin-Control-Using-Telegram-Bot
Controlling  LED with the Telegram bot, the LED is connected to the ESP32 board. Instead of the LED, you can control any pin connected to any other appliance or component.

<b> INTRODUCTION</b><br>
To control the ESP32 or ESP8266 NodeMCU GPIOs from anywhere in the world using Telegram. As an example, we’ll control an LED, but you can control any other output. You just need to send a message to your Telegram Bot to set your outputs HIGH or LOW. The ESP boards will be programmed using Arduino IDE.
Telegram Messenger is a cloud-based instant messaging and voice over IP service. You can easily install it in your smartphone (Android and iPhone) or computer (PC, Mac and Linux). It is free and without any ads. Telegram allows you to create bots that you can interact with.
“Bots are third-party applications that run inside Telegram. Users can interact with bots by sending them messages, commands and inline requests. You control your bots using HTTPS requests to Telegram Bot API“.
The ESP32/ESP8266 will interact with the Telegram bot to receive and handle the messages, and send responses. In this tutorial you’ll learn how to use Telegram to send messages to your bot to control the ESP outputs from anywhere (you just need Telegram and access to the internet).<br>
